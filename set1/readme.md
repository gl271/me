TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Reflection**
This week consisted of downloading the materials to run python and other general code fundamentals. By adding a directory and direct channel of where to get the exercise from git hub, I learn how git hub works similarly to how a cloud system works but for code. By understanding that by committing the updates and labelling the changes it lets future me see what changes have occurred within the code and what problems I had and how I solved it.
**Troubleshooting**
