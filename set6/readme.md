TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

working on my panda file makes me wanna cri :(

- Got to break down the airbnb and what to derive from the data.

Looking into popular names and dates that would be booked.
Maybe looking into locations or such.

More plotting learning

- ideas from class
- scatter graphs, and can change colours and data arrangements.
