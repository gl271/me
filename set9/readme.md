TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Had to go over loops and arrays and such in word details to see if any of them were relevant to what I'm trying to achieve.
Pandas groupby -need to learn more about so I can use it more/ and I want to see how to move from a shatter graph to a geopandas.
