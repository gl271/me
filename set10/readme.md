TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Re-learning panda geo-graphing and see what plots would be best for presenting data.

Noted that I have to learn the presentation style on jup - not too sure how much I should be presenting but twas interesting to focus on specific dates and looking at people who had the most listings and where their location placements are.
