TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we learn the .append function to set loops and arrays. I struggled a bit in the beginning trying to understand how to set up the grid like applications within the .append; but as I went on along with some help I began to understand how the variable i and j respond with said function.
It also helped to learn how to debug and break up the code so we could understand what is happening up until a certain point.
I still feel a little lost when it comes to breaking down the if, else and elif syntax - with some more practice and applications I'll understand more clearly.
