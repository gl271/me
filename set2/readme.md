TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we learn the .append function to set loops and arrays. I struggled a bit in the beginning trying to understand how to set up the grid like applications within the .append; but as I went on along with some help I began to understand how the variable i and j respond with said function. It also helped to learn how to debug and break up the code so we could understand what is happening up until a certain point.
I still feel a little lost when it comes to breaking down the if, else and elif syntax - with some more practice and applications I'll understand more clearly.
One thing that did frustrate me was having to restructure/change my code a little despite it returning the desired response as the autotest runs don't accept any minor changes. It happened during the ex 3 loops when I added extra spacing and brackets to allow to results to come up neater - but the auto-test only sees it as the wrong answer.
