TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week killed me, thanks ben <3

While correct_answer == False --> this means keeps looping until correct answer

i = input() --> asks the user to input something = input = the variable that needs to be entered (i = x, j = y math terms)

int = whole numbers
chr = words
float = decimals

.isinstance checks variable to see what type it is (number or word etc) - specified in int or chr --> in an if statement
eg. if .isinstance(number, int) == True:
--------print("Number is an integer")

temp values = holds the past number in lieu of not overwriting the last one
eg. swapping variables
-------- if LowerBound > UpperBound:
--------print("swap it you idiot")
--------------temp = LowerBound
--------------LowerBound = UpperBound
--------------UpperBound = temp

random.randint = random variables
