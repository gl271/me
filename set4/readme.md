TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

How to open JSON files and making sure everything is written with order of the file ref[][].
how to break a URL apart to change and code one small section by adding parts together and making sure that the variables are in the right place.
How to create and write into a file within the code using the different modes "r" and "w" and being aware of where files are in the folder.

unsure if I need to always add and specific what in the code is being read - eg. ...text as seen in word-pyramid
